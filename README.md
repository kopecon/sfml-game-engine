# My first C++ project.

- This is simply a practice project for learning C++ / modern C++ and proper game design practices.
- The commit messages for this project are somewhat neglected as there is no intention for proper collaboration
  and I do not want to waste energy on them.
- That also applies for commenting my code as I am trying to learn the minimal amount of commenting needed for
  maintaining understandability and practicing self-explanatory coding.
- ChatGPT is used for feedback and learning, never for blunt code generation.
